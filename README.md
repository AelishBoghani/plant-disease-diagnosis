## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT

## Problem Introduction

• In this project we are using image processing to see if plant has any disease or

not.

• Sometimes these centers are so far for a farmer and also he has to wait for the

test results.

• These may lead again to the failure of the crops. So our project is based on this

idea that farmers need not to visit help centers or wait for the test. We have

developed an AI project in which farmer need to only capture an image of the

crop that is suspicious and our model will give all the details of disease and

which pesticides to use to overcome this disease.

## Problem Description

• Sometimes farmers lack of knowledge lead them to use inappropriate pesticides

for the crops when a crop has diseases. If a farmer found something in crops, He

has to give samples to nearest agricultural center.

• We capture an image of plant’s leaf and check in our model. Our model gives

which type of possible disease so we can use proper pesticides to use to

overcome that diseases.

## Methodology

• We have used DenseNet121 CNN model.

• For image processing we have used Tensorflow, numpy,

Keras application, seaborn and sklearn.

• We have used CV2 for resize the images and used google Colab for

model training.

• DenseNet falls in the category of classic networks. This image

shows a 5-layer dense block with a growth rate of k = 4 and the

standard ResNet structure. An output of the previous layer acts as

an input of the second layer by using composite function

operation.

## Features

• We have created web app for Prediction of Plant disease

• Famer have to just put image of plant’s leaf in our web app.

• Our model gives disease name of plants, so farmer can use proper

pesticide.

• The best thing of our model is that it gives 97% accuracy.
